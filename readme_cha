in CommonButton component we pass children as props
->the children prop allow us to pass JSX into an element (besides regular pros)
using this props we can define as money as attributes to CommonButton JSX

<CommonButton
    textColor="#fff"
    bgColor="#7950f2"
    onClick={handleNext}
    >
            Next Using Common Btn<span>ðŸ‘‰</span>
</CommonButton>

after closing tag we can use more content because we pass children as prop
